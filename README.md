# flutter_camerakit
A Flutter plugin for Android and iOS allowing access to the device cameras, a bit deeper!!. This plugin was created to offer more advanced features than the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/camera">Flutter official Camera plugin</a>. 

NB: For Android, the required sdk version is also dropped down to 15 or higher (as the official plugin only supports android sdk 21 and higher).

## Installation
Add the following section as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).
```dart
flutter_camerakit: 
    git:
      url: https://github.com/hramaroson/flutter_camerakit.git
