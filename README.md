# flutter_camerakit
Flutter plugin to use Camera. This plugin was created to offer more advanced features than the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/camera">Flutter official Camera plugin</a>. 

NB: For Android, the required sdk vesion is also dropped down to 19 or higher (as the official plugin only support android sdk 21 and higher).
